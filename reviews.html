      I guess as an afterthought, what I really mean here is don't compare
      yourself to others in a negative way that is ultimately going to hurt
      you. I think that is more specific to what I mean, because there are
      ways and reasons to compare in a healthy way.

    <h2>PUBG</h2>

    <p>
      PUBG is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred
      players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man
      standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive.
      Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team
      of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.[2]
      Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of
      the four maps, with areas of approximately 8 × 8 kilometres (5.0 × 5.0
      mi), 6 × 6 kilometres (3.7 × 3.7 mi), and 4 × 4 kilometres (2.5 × 2.5
      mi) in size.[3] The plane's flight path across the map varies with
      each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to
      eject and parachute to the ground.[2] Players start with no gear
      beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay.
      Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other
      sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These
      items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of
      a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having better
      equipment.[2] Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as
      well.[2] Players can opt to play either from the first-person or
      third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and
      disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though
      server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one
      perspective to eliminate some advantages.[4]
